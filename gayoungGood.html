                                <p>I have worked at Oohoo IT services in Campus Saint Jean as a programmer for my Industrial Internship Program
                                    for 19 months.  During this time, I was in charge of developing a Moodle module to create an interactive
                                    electronic textbooks.  I have gained various skills during this internship including: 
                                    PHP, HTML, CSS, javascript, jQuery, Java, XSLT, XML, Moodle API, MySQL, Apache, client interaction, 
                                    project management.</p>
                                <p> I have also been part of Hacking Health Hackathon event in November where people in health care professions
                                    and technology/development field work together to address various problems in health care field that are proposed
                                    by different people in two days.  I was part of a team of four (only developer) for a project called TrialConnect
                                    that was a website proposed to "match" researchers and patients to drug trials.  By end of the two days, we had a 
                                    working UI for the website.</p>
